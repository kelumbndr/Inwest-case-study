### For the time being I have added both backend and front end to same repository

For Banckend switch to the folder **INWEST-BACKEND**

1. You will need node js installed (I'm using **node v14.18.1**)

 2. Within folder INWEST-BACKEND run the command **npm install**

 3. After installing the packages simply run **node .\transaction-api.js**
 You can also run the backend using **nodemon .\transaction-api.js**. For this you ned to have node monitor installed **npm i -g nodemon**

For your ease you can use following postman collection to test the APIs
